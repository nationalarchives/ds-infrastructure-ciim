In the late 1960s and early 1970s some feminists involved in the Womens' Liberation Movement of that time, encouraged women take control of their bodies by learning to examine themselves using a speculum, a torch and a mirror.  This included demanding safe and legal abortions on demand.
The book 'Our Bodies Ourselves' by and for women was published in 1970 on this same theme.
Carol Downer and Lorraine Rothman were the leaders of the group that founded the 'Feminist Womens' Health Center' in Los Angeles in 1971.  They travelled the US to share their information and help to set up other groups around the country.
