He made 'sprags' for lorries and spliced wire cables for barrage balloons during the first World War.\r\n\r\nRecollection of the petrol-driven shunting engine used on the factory site, which Percy rode on as a boy [connecting to the Southern Railway].\r\n\r\nPercy's apprenticeship at Dennis.  He began as office boy in various offices (cost office, drawing office, staff, publicity), then transferred to the factory.  He was soon made redundant: women, then apprentices were laid off by Dennis in 1920\r\n\r\nPercy's apprenticeship was transferred to Weyside Engineering in Farnham Road, Guildford.\r\n\r\nPercy's recollection of one of the Dennis managers, for whom Percy brought a new bottle of Whisky daily\r\n\r\nRecollection of the running of the firm, which was bankrupt in 1912 [before being floated in 1913].  'German' money went into the company.  Interest in lorries only came with the war.\r\n\r\nPercy's recollection of a Dennis 3 ton lorry used by Percy with his boss Harold Puttock (who left in 1926): the gears were perfect after 300 thousand miles.\r\n\r\nPercy's final task at Dennis in 1920, which was to seal 750 letters of redundancy, including one addressed to his father.\r\n\r\nRecollections by Percy Hole and Walter Thelwall of fellow employees at Dennis: Bill/James Jolly, Billy Greaves, Joe Taylor, Shackleton, Warrener, and 'Old Flo'; also man who worked on the roller mills, and Percy's sister, who worked on the mills, 1915-1919, doing shackles (semi-automatic mills were still in use in 1940); Mr Thelwall recalls Frank Brown, who came to Dennis as an apprentice, worked on turning machines, and left Dennis after 33 years to become an inspector at Weyside Engineering [see -/4 below].\r\n\r\nPercy's recollections of an accident at No 3 Shop, when the Dennis' chauffeur took the casualty in Mrs Dennis' Dennis car\r\n\r\nMr Thelwall's recollection of a near accident at No 7 Shop during World War II, when the hair of one of the girls was caught in a machine spindle.\r\n\r\nThe 8 girls were sent from Tottenham.\r\n\r\nPercy's recollections of serving tea to the staff; recollections of tea shops of Guildford: Queens Cakes, Onslow Street, and Hicks Bakers.

The Athletic Club and Dance Club and concert party events were reported.\r\n\r\nRecollection of Percy and the new office boy shooting at bulbs.

He had his photograph taken by Dennis publicity.\r\n\r\nPercy's recollection of criticising the Dennis Stork, without realising he was speaking to the designer, Mr Milne.

He chose Dennis from a choice of 'three or four', and started work in Aug 1917.\r\n\r\nHe did stints in various parts of the factory, beginning with grinding.  The apprenticeship finished in 1921, when he left as an 'improver'.  he returned to Dennis after 2 years.\r\n\r\nRecollections of automation of the machines.  Frank had charge of 2 machines.  Mr Thelwall operated a semi-automatic mill.\r\n\r\nRecollections of the ability of foreman Lance Edwards, and the skill required to operate machinery: even the experienced operator was injured on the automatic turret lathe.\r\n\r\nNew machines were acquired when Dennis moved to Woodbridge Hill.\r\n\r\nRecollections of the General Strike of 1926.  Dennis men were to be dismissed, but the partners wanted the master gearcutter Rapson back, so they took everyone.\r\n\r\nFrank went to London as a special constable, but the strike was over when he arrived.  He claims that 'nobody's heart was in it'.\r\n\r\nFrank's recollections of what he describes as the obstructiveness of the unions, when he was a mechanical inspector [at Weyside Engineering].\r\n\r\nRecollections of the Dennis subsidy engine, which was slow but long-lasting.

The railings ('bars') in front of the workshop 'are still there'.  Their foundry was where the [Yvonne Arnaud] theatre now is, where iron moulding and casting (using various metals) took place.  They made high speed steam engines for use on ships, boat reversing gears and 'all sorts', including work for Dennis Bros, Guildford.  Robinson worked as a pattern maker.\r\n\r\nThe firm was later the 'Hays Brothers', one of whom worked in the drawing office, the other as an engineer.\r\n\r\nMr Robinson volunteered for the Queen's Regiment and began his training as a private.  But when those with engineering experience were asked to stand forward, he did and was 'glad to do something more interesting'. Describes being tested at a site in Cobham for his ability to 'make a dovetail'.  He was quickly approved, and sent for training in flying at Beverley [Yorkshire] racecourse (touchdowns are described).  'There was no real flying corps' at that time.\r\n\r\nHe was sent to Alexandria, and eventually 'up the line' to Jerusalem, after being sent to Mesopotamia 'by mistake'.  He met T E Lawrence [of Arabia] and General Edmund Allenby [later Field Marshal Viscount Allenby of Megiddo] (described).\r\n\r\nDescribes preparing aircraft and fitting bombs.\r\n\r\nMr Robinson flew an RE8 12 cylinder.\r\n\r\nWhen he was being shown how to fly it, half the wing fell off.

Transcripts of the interviews were added to this collection in December 2019.","The first Gypsy Roma Traveller History month was held in June 2008. The nationwide project was directed towards schools, libraries, museums and cinemas with the aim of educating a wider audience about traveller history and culture. The initiative started in 2003 in the London Borough of Brent and spread across the country following public support and funding from the Department of Children, Schools and Families. As part of the activities and to support its own oral history project, Woking Lightbox recorded a series of interviews with Surrey travellers at Bourne Hall Museum, Ewell, in June 2008.\r\n\r\nGypsy Roma Traveller History Month was part of a wider initiative, based at Surrey History Centre headed 'Roads to Your Past'. Funded jointly between the European Union and South East Museum Library and Archive Council, the initiative aimed to encourage greater access to local heritage centres by traveller communities and promote a wider appreciation of gypsy/Romany culture. The relevance of the project is probably best summarized by Len Smith, traveller, who says 'Museums, libraries and archives could be powerful places for us if we can make them accessible. You bring two people in, and they tell four people and the four people tell another four people and it can start giving gypsies and travellers a bit more pride - we have a private pride in our culture – we need a public pride; we need a public face to our pride' (from Private Past, Public Future: see related records below).","A report entitled 'Private Past, Public Future', can be viewed on the Surrey History Centre website.  The report, compiled by Jake Bowers, assesses how traveller communities perceive the preservation of their culture by local heritage centres."

These records are the outcome of the National Lottery Heritage Fund-funded project 'The Living and the Dead: Exploring minority burial grounds in Brookwood Cemetery, Surrey'. The project was implemented over a two-year period from September 2020 to September 2022. It was led by Woking Asian Business Forum, working with Brookwood Cemetery, Surrey History Centre, The Lightbox and Brookwood Cemetery Society.\r\n\r\nUnknown to most, Brookwood Cemetery (Surrey HER Park and Garden 3723) is host to the highest concentration of minority burial grounds in the UK. Apart from a wide range of Muslim burial grounds, dating from 1884, these include the first Zoroastrian burial ground established in Europe, in 1862. These burial grounds constitute an important part of Brookwood Cemetery, and they represent a unique cultural heritage that has so far remained undocumented. The aim of the project was to collect information about the burial grounds and make this information available to the public.  Various strands of the project included conducting oral history interviews with a range of people associated with the Cemetery, making a film about the minority burial grounds in the Cemetery, and recording data about minority burials from the burial registers.",,,,,,Catalogued,71d23aa1-7d90-4cf7-a5e3-c8f5e2e40235

The study highlighted that Surrey had lost over 85% of its heathland since the late 18th century.\r\n\r\nAs a result, in 1989 the Heathland Countryside Management Project (later to become Surrey Heathland Project) was set up to help stop the decline. The project initially carried out practical work with help from committed volunteers, using hand tools to clear scrub and control bracken on hundreds of hectares of heathland. However it became clear that this method could not keep pace with the rolling tide of scrub invasion. To make best use of limited resources, the project increasingly used chainsaw operators and contractors with machinery.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 the Surrey Heathland Project began to manage a 5 year programme of heathland restoration work called Surrey's Last Wilderness on behalf of a partnership of 13 organisations. This was part of a large-scale national scheme with £1 million funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Surrey's Last Wilderness achieved over 1,000 hectares of heathland management and restoration, and introduced conservation grazing to manage 900 hectares of heathland.\r\n\r\nPart of the project included raising awareness of heathland and to promoting its value. The reminiscences of people who live and work on Surrey heathlands proved a valuable contribution to the project demonstrating how important and sustaining areas of heathland are to local communities.",Open,,There are no access restrictions.,,
